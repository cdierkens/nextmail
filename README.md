**Nextmail** makes it easy to leverage `React` and `MJML` to craft custom, dynamic email templates.

- Declarative, component-based model with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Responsive out of the box with [MJML](https://mjml.io/)
- Iterate quickly with browser previews
- Unit test with `jest` or however you choose, the same way you test your front end
- Fetch asynchronous data with `getInitialProps`, inspired by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- File based API, inspired by the `pages` model in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
